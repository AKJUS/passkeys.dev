Passkeys are:

**Intuitive**<br>Creating and using passkeys is as simple as consenting to save and use them. No having to create a password.

**Automatically unique per-service**<br>By design, passkeys are unique per-service. There’s no chance to reuse them.

**Breach-resistant**<br>A passkey is only stored on a user’s devices. RP servers store public keys. Even servers that assist in the syncing of passkeys across a user’s devices never have the ability to view or use the private keys for a user's passkeys.

**Phishing-resistant**<br>Rather than trust being rooted in a human who has to verify they’re signing into the right website or app, browser, and operating systems enforce that passkeys are only ever used for the appropriate service.
