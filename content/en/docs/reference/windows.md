## Overview

Windows Hello, the platform authenticator in Windows 10 and 11, has the following capabilities:

- creating and using [***single-device*** passkeys](/docs/reference/terms/#single-device-passkey) that are bound to the device
- creating and using [***single-device*** passkeys](/docs/reference/terms/#single-device-passkey) on a FIDO2 security key

<!--TODO: Add cross link to CDA-->
Passkeys from Android, iOS, and iPadOS can be used in Chrome (105+) and Edge (105+) for signing in to web services using FIDO Cross-Device Authentication.
