## Overview

Windows Hello, the local platform authenticator in Windows 10 and 11, has the following capabilities:

- creating and using [***device-bound*** passkeys](/docs/reference/terms/#device-bound-passkey) on the local device
- creating and using [***device-bound*** passkeys](/docs/reference/terms/#device-bound-passkey) on a FIDO2 security key

The following is also possible in both Windows 10 and 11:

- using passkeys from iOS and iPadOS devices in Chrome (108+) and Edge (108+) for signing in to web services using [FIDO Cross-Device Authentication](/docs/reference/terms/#cross-device-authentication-cda)
- using passkeys from Android devices in Chrome (108+) and Edge (108+) for signing in to web services using [FIDO Cross-Device Authentication](/docs/reference/terms/#cross-device-authentication-cda)
